                    <p>
                        During my Motorola Internship, I spearheaded the development of a high-tech solutions project called HotSpot, designed to optimize the air travel experience for local, national, and global travelers during the pandemic.
                        The project, sponsored by Motorola, was mainly centered around designing a product in a specific way so that it could minimize the risk of spreading COVID-19 in crowded areas at the airport using electrical hardware components and a software platform. 
                        I also designed and tested a HotSpot Sensory and Drone Package to collect data, and imported the data into a thermal density and heat map using JavaScript.

                    <h1>Crowe National Case Competition</h1>
                    <p>
                        In the competition, my focus was in line with the "Guardians of Integrity," a group dedicated to preventing and detecting fraud. 
                        I investigated how artificial intelligence could be used to improve the management of fraud risks, and proposed inventive approaches and answers for organizations seeking to protect themselves from AI-related fraud risks, such as bribery, corruption, disbursements, expense management, third-party risk, and vendor fraud. 
                        My proposed and developed solutions revolved around Anomaly Detection, Predictive Analysis, Natural Language Processing, Real-time monitoring, and Behavior Analysis to identify fraudulent transactions or schemes that might evolve and alter the conventional definition and characteristics of fraud.

                        I am currently a consultant in the International Consulting Network (ICON), working in an international team to create an innovative project for a corporation located across the world. 
                        I am engaging in collaboration with global technology through international consulting projects, networking opportunities, and professional development. 
                        At the end of the semester, I will be a part of a business trip, presenting my final project and proposal to business leaders in countries across the world, ranging from Sweden and New York to Shanghai and South Korea.
